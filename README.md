## Introduction
My code from working with THE BIG BOOK OF SMALL PYTHON PROJECTS

## Getting Started

Install Python 3 using Homebrew or your fav package manager:

1. **Install Homebrew** (if you haven't already):

   - Run the following command to install Homebrew:
     ```sh
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

2. **Install Python 3**:
   - Run the following command to install Python 3:
     ```sh
     brew install python
     ```

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - After the installation is complete, run the following command to ensure Python 3 is installed correctly:
     ```sh
     python3 --version
     ```
   - You should see output indicating the version of Python 3 that is installed, such as:
     ```sh
     Python 3.x.x
     ```

4. **Git Clone**
    - Use Git Clone to get the directory of projects
    ```sh
    git clone git@github.com:GnarlyLasagna/81-python-projects.git
    ```

5. **Cd in and use script**
    -Cd into the directory of the desired project:
    ```sh
    cd bagels
    ```

    ```sh
    python3 bagels.py
    ```

## Bagels

[test link to code page](https://github.com/GnarlyLasagna/81-python-projects/blob/main/bagels/bagels.py)

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you
must guess a secret three-digit number
based on clues. The game offers one of
the following hints in response to your guess:
“Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the
wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct
digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess
has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the
secret number.

## Birthday Paradox

The Birthday Paradox, also called the
Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high
probability that two people will have the
same birthday even in a small group of people.
In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance
of two people having a matching birthday. But even
in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent
chance of a matching birthday. This program per-
forms several probability experiments to determine
the percentages for groups of different sizes. We call these types of experi-
ments, in which we conduct multiple random trials to understand the
likely outcomes, Monte Carlo experiments.
