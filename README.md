## Getting Started
## Installing Python 3 with Homebrew

Install Python 3 using Homebrew or your fav package manager:

1. **Install Homebrew** (if you haven't already):

   - Run the following command to install Homebrew:
     ```sh
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```

2. **Install Python 3**:
   - Run the following command to install Python 3:
     ```sh
     brew install python
     ```

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - After the installation is complete, run the following command to ensure Python 3 is installed correctly:
     ```sh
     python3 --version
     ```
   - You should see output indicating the version of Python 3 that is installed, such as:
     ```sh
     Python 3.x.x
     ```

## Bagels

[test link to code page](http://url.com)

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you
must guess a secret three-digit number
based on clues. The game offers one of
the following hints in response to your guess:
“Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the
wrong place, “Fermi” when your guess has a correct
digit in the correct place, and “Bagels” if your guess
has no correct digits. You have 10 tries to guess the
secret number.

## Birthday Paradox

The Birthday Paradox, also called the
Birthday Problem, is the surprisingly high
probability that two people will have the
same birthday even in a small group of people.
In a group of 70 people, there’s a 99.9 percent chance
of two people having a matching birthday. But even
in a group as small as 23 people, there’s a 50 percent
chance of a matching birthday. This program per-
forms several probability experiments to determine
the percentages for groups of different sizes. We call these types of experi-
ments, in which we conduct multiple random trials to understand the
likely outcomes, Monte Carlo experiments.
